# KnowU---Powered-by-IBM-Watson
Brings the power of IBM Watson's Personality Insights to your android device.

This project in `GitHub` contains just one module of my app `KnowU`, which automatically monitors the users activities in the smartphone and gets data from it to be processed using `IBM Watson`. It periodically notifies the user when enough data is collected and the user's personality can be reviewed.
You can take a look at the whole project from this video link.

This project allows users to enter some text and then pass it to Watson which gives you a detailed analysis on your personality. I have used `MPCharts` here to show the results in a better way to the user.

The goal of KnowU is to identify the personality of the user without any physical interference of the user and help them in analysing their capabilities. Yes, KnowU does not need the user to feed data to it. 

It will learn from the users activities which they do in their smartphone and will notify the user once it has enough data to analyse them. Then based on the IBM Watson's personality insight's, it will provide them results in a charted manner with which they can learn about their various personality insights. 

Using this results, the user can know where they stand in their inner personality. This will help the user to groom their personality and eventually groom our world. Currently I have just shown the personality the user has based on his smartphone usage. 

In future, I will show them suggestions based on their personality like what they have to do to improve themselves. What they are in need for and such things. This has endless possibilities sitting right inside the hands of the user.
