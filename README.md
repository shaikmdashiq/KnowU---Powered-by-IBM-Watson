# KnowU---Powered-by-IBM-Watson
Brings the power of IBM Watson's Personality Insights to your android device.

This project contains just one module of my app KnowU, which automatically monitors the users activities and gets data from it to be processed using `IBM Watson`. It periodically notifies the user when enough data is collected and the user's personality can be reviewed.
You can take a look at the whole project from this video link.

This project allows users to enter some text and then pass it to Watson which gives you a detailed analysis on your personality. I have used `MPCharts` here to show the results in a better way to the user.
